Red, Gold, Green, Black Star on my back
Politicians dey steal but police dey attack
The regular citizens who no want slack
As the greedy politician kills our land

Red, Gold, Green, Black Star in my mind
Greedy politicians tell me, what you dey find
You've spoilt the water in Ghana
Now man no fit drink
Run we dey run but you dey lash we add
