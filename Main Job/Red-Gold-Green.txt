Red, Gold, Green, Black Star on my back
Police dey attack based on orders from above
Police is not your friend, stand and fight for your right
If Ghana's water bodies and forests die 
We the citizens all die

Red, Gold, Green, Black Star in my mind 
Mr Politician what at all you want find
What you've stolen so far you can't leave them behind
Freedom and justice only applies to a few
While the rest of the people struggle to make do

Red, Gold, Green, Black Star in my head
Galamsey dey kill the people of Akuffo-Addo's Ghana
He as the president clearly could care less
We the citizens demand he #FreeTheCitizens and #StopGalamseyNow
